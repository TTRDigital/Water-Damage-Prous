 * Static export for SiteGround (Apache) hosting: `npm run build` writes plain
 * HTML/CSS/JS to `out/`, which goes into public_html.
 *
 * What a static host has no Node server for lives elsewhere:
 * - redirects, security headers (CSP), caching and compression: public/.htaccess
 * - the lead forms: public/api/lead.php (PHP, forwards to GoHighLevel)
 * - images: WebP copies made before the build by scripts/optimize-images.mjs,
 *   picked by lib/image-loader.ts
 * - CMS updates: rebuild and upload (.github/workflows/deploy-siteground.yml),
 *   started by a push, a Sanity webhook or the "Run workflow" button
